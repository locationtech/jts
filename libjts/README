Native build of JTS library
---------------------------

This directory contains scripts to build shared native
libraries out of JTS code using GCJ (the GNU Java Compiler).

We build two libraries: one is a direct mapping from Java
code as produced by GCJ, the other is a wrapper library for
non-OO languages (primarly C), using abstract types and function
prefixes instead of classes and namespaces.

The C wrapper is libjts_c.so and requires inclusion of jts_c.h
(read the latter for usage informations). It does NOT provide
all of JTS functionalities but does provide all geometry 
operations.

The C++ library is libjts.so and provides a bounch of headers
layed out after package names (com/vividsolutions/....) plus
an entry-point header including the inner ones for you: jts.h.

Both libraries provide garbage collection (actually provided
by libgcj.so linked by libjts.so linked by libjts_c.so).

As a side-effect of producing the headers we also produce
a .jar file, being an intermediate step. I didn't compare
quality of GCJ-produced .jar file and the SUN's JAVAC produced
one, might be worth trying...
