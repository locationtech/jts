/**
 * Unions a collection of Geometry or a single Geometry 
 * (which may be a collection) together.
 * By using this special-purpose operation over a collection of geometries
 * it is possible to take advantage of various optimizations to improve performance.
 * Heterogeneous {@link GeometryCollection}s are fully supported.
 * <p>
 * The result obeys the following contract:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Unioning a set of overlapping {@link Polygons}s has the effect of
 * merging the areas (i.e. the same effect as 
 * iteratively unioning all individual polygons together).
 * 
 * <li>Unioning a set of {@link LineString}s has the effect of <b>noding</b> 
 * and <b>dissolving</b> the input linework.
 * In this context "fully noded" means that there will be 
 * an endpoint or node in the result 
 * for every endpoint or line segment crossing in the input.
 * "Dissolved" means that any duplicate (i.e. coincident) line segments or portions
 * of line segments will be reduced to a single line segment in the result.  
 * This is consistent with the semantics of the 
 * {@link Geometry#union(Geometry)} operation.
 * If <b>merged</b> linework is required, the {@link LineMerger} class can be used.
 * 
 * <li>Unioning a set of {@link Points}s has the effect of merging
 * all identical points (producing a set with no duplicates).
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <tt>UnaryUnion</tt> always operates on the individual components of MultiGeometries.
 * So it is possible to use it to "clean" invalid self-intersecting MultiPolygons
 * (although the polygon components must all still be individually valid.)
