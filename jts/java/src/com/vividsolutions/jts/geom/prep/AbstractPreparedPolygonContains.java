 * Uses short-circuit tests and indexing to improve performance. 
 * <p>
 * Contains and covers are very similar, and differ only in how certain

 * in the case where line segments of the test geometry touches the polygon linework.
 * In this case full topology must be computed.
 * (However, if the test geometry consists of only points, this 
 * <i>can</i> be evaluated in an optimized fashion.
