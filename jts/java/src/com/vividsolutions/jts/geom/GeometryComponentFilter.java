/**
 *  <code>Geometry</code> classes support the concept of applying
 *  a <code>GeometryComponentFilter</code>
 *  filter to the <code>Geometry</code>.
 *  The filter is applied to every component of the <code>Geometry</code>
 *  which is itself a <code>Geometry</code>
 *  and which does not itself contain any components.
 * (For instance, all the {@link LinearRing}s in {@link Polygon}s are visited,
 * but in a {@link MultiPolygon} the {@link Polygon}s themselves are not visited.)
 * Thus the only classes of Geometry which must be 
 * handled as arguments to {@link #filter}
 * are {@link LineString}s, {@link LinearRing}s and {@link Point}s.
 *  <p>
 *  A <code>GeometryComponentFilter</code> filter can either
 *  record information about the <code>Geometry</code>
 *  or change the <code>Geometry</code> in some way.
 *  <code>GeometryComponentFilter</code>
 *  is an example of the Gang-of-Four Visitor pattern.
