/**
 * A Quadtree is a spatial index structure for efficient querying
 * of 2D rectangles.  If other kinds of spatial objects
 * need to be indexed they can be represented by their
 * envelopes
 * <p>
 * The quadtree structure is used to provide a primary filter
 * for range rectangle queries.  The query() method returns a list of
 * all objects which <i>may</i> intersect the query rectangle.  Note that
 * it may return objects which do not in fact intersect.
 * A secondary filter is required to test for exact intersection.
 * Of course, this secondary filter may consist of other tests besides
 * intersection, such as testing other kinds of spatial relationships.
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation does not require specifying the extent of the inserted
 * items beforehand.  It will automatically expand to accomodate any extent
 * of dataset.
 * <p>
 * This data structure is also known as an <i>MX-CIF quadtree</i>
 * following the usage of Samet and others.
