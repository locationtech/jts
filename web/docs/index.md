# JTS Topology Suite

The JTS Topology Suite (JTS) is an open source Java software library
that provides an object model for planar geometry together with a set of
fundamental geometric functions. JTS conforms to the Simple Features
Specification for SQL published by the Open GIS Consortium. JTS is
designed to be used as a core component of vector-based geomatics
software such as geographical information systems. It can also be used
as a general-purpose library providing algorithms in computational
geometry.
