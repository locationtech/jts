/**
 * Cleans the linework of a set of polygonal geometries to form a valid polygonal coverage.
 * The input is an array of valid {@link Polygon} or {@link MultiPolygon} geometries 
 * which may contain topological errors such as overlaps and gaps.
 * Empty or non-polygonal inputs are removed.
 * Linework is snapped together to eliminate small discrepancies.
 * Overlaps are merged with an adjacent polygon, according to a given merge strategy.
 * Gaps narrower than a given width are filled and merged with an adjacent polygon.
 * The output is an array of polygonal geometries forming a valid polygonal coverage.
 * 
 * <h3>Snapping</h3>
 * 
 * Snapping to nearby vertices and line segment snapping is used to improve noding robustness 
 * and eliminate small errors in an efficient way,  
 * By default this uses a very small snapping distance based on the extent of the input data.
 * The snapping distance may be specified explicitly.
 * This can reduce the number of overlaps and gaps that need to be merged,
 * and reduce the risk of spikes formed by merging gaps.
 * However, a large snapping distance may introduce undesirable data alteration.
 * 
 * <h3>Overlap Merging</h3>
 * 
 * Overlaps are merged with an adjacent polygon chosen according to a specified merge strategy.
 * The supported strategies are:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Longest Border</b>: (default) merge with the polygon with longest shared border
 * ({@link #MERGE_LONGEST_BORDER}.)
 * <li><b>Maximum/Minimum Area</b>: merge with the polygon with largest or smallest area
 * ({@link #MERGE_MAX_AREA}, {@link #MERGE_MIN_AREA}.)
 * <li><b>Minimum Index</b>: merge with the polygon with the lowest index in the input array
 * ({@link #MERGE_MIN_INDEX}.)
 * This allows sorting the input according to some criteria to provide a priority 
 * for merging gaps.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Gap Merging</h3>
 * 
 * Gaps which are wider than a given distance are merged with an adjacent polygon.
 * Polygon width is determined as twice the radius of the {@link MaximumInscribedCircle}
 * of the gap polygon.
 * Gaps are merged with the adjacent polygon with longest shared border.
 * Empty holes in input polygons are treated as gaps, and may be filled in.
 * Gaps which are not fully enclosed ("inlets") are not removed.
 * <p>
 * Cleaning can be run on a valid coverage to remove gaps.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The clean result is an array of polygonal geometries 
 * which match one-to-one with the input array.
 * A result item may be <tt>null</tt> if:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the input item is non-polygonal or empty
 * <li>the input item is so small it is snapped to collapse
 * <li>the input item is covered by another input item 
 * (which may be a larger or a duplicate (nearly or exactly) geometry)
 * </ul>
 * The result is a valid coverage according to {@link CoverageValidator#isValid(Geometry[])}; 
 * 
 * <h3>Known Issues</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Long narrow gaps adjacent to multiple polygons may form spikes when merged with a single polygon. 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Provide an area-based tolerance for gap merging
 * <li>Prevent long narrow gaps from forming spikes by partitioning them before merging.
 * <li>Allow merging narrow parts of a gap while leaving wider portions.
 * <li>Support a priority value for each input polygon to control overlap and gap merging
 * (this could also allow blocking polygons from being merge targets)
 * </ul>
