/**
 * Builds an {@link AffineTransformation} defined by a set of control vectors. 
 * A control vector consists of a source point and a destination point, 
 * which is the image of the source point under the desired transformation.
 * <p>
 * A transformation is well-defined 
 * by a set of three control vectors 
 * if and only if the source points are not collinear. 
 * (In particular, the degenerate situation
 * where two or more source points are identical will not produce a well-defined transformation).
 * A well-defined transformation exists and is unique.
 * If the control vectors are not well-defined, the system of equations
 * defining the transformation matrix entries is not solvable,
 * and no transformation can be determined.
 * <p>
 * No such restriction applies to the destination points.
 * However, if the destination points are collinear or non-unique,
 * a non-invertible transformations will be generated.
 * <p>
 * This technique of recovering a transformation
 * from its effect on known points is used in the Bilinear Interpolated Triangulation
 * algorithm for warping planar surfaces.
