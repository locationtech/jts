/**
 * Validates a polygonal coverage, and returns the locations of
 * invalid polygon boundary segments if found.
 * <p>
 * A polygonal coverage is a set of polygons which may be edge-adjacent but do 
 * not overlap.
 * Coverage algorithms (such as {@link CoverageUnion} or simplification) 
 * generally require the input coverage to be valid to produce correct results.
 * A polygonal coverage is valid if:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The interiors of all polygons do not intersect (are disjoint).
 * This is the case if no polygon has a boundary which intersects the interior of another polygon,
 * and no two polygons are identical.
 * <li>If the boundaries of polygons intersect, the vertices
 * and line segments of the intersection match exactly.
 * </ol> 
 * <p>
 * A valid coverage may contain holes (regions of no coverage).
 * Sometimes it is desired to detect whether coverages contain 
 * holes which are narrow gaps between polygons
 * (which can be a result of digitizing error or misaligned data).
 * This class can detect narrow gaps, 
 * by specifying a maximum gap width using {@link #setGapWidth(double)}.
 * Note that this also identifies narrow gaps separating disjoint coverage regions, 
 * and narrow gores.
 * In some situations it may also produce false positives 
 * (linework identified as part of a gap which is actually wider).
 * See {@link CoverageGapFinder} for an alternate way to detect gaps which may be more accurate.
 * 
 * <h3>Known Bugs</h3>
 * If the specified gap width is large, some narrow gaps may not be identified.
