/**
 * A Quadtree is a spatial index structure for efficient range querying
 * of items bounded by 2D rectangles.  
 * {@link Geometry}s can be indexed by using their
 * {@link Envelope}s.
 * Any type of Object can also be indexed as
 * long as it has an extent that can be represented by an {@link Envelope}.
 * <p>
 * This Quadtree index provides a <b>primary filter</b>
 * for range rectangle queries.  The various query methods return a list of
 * all items which <i>may</i> intersect the query rectangle.  Note that
 * it may thus return items which do <b>not</b> in fact intersect the query rectangle.
 * A secondary filter is required to test for actual intersection 
 * between the query rectangle and the envelope of each candidate item. 
 * The secondary filter may be performed explicitly, 
 * or it may be provided implicitly by subsequent operations executed on the items 
 * (for instance, if the index query is followed by computing a spatial predicate 
 * between the query geometry and tree items, 
 * the envelope intersection check is performed automatically.
 * <p>
 * This implementation does not require specifying the extent of the inserted
 * items beforehand.  It will automatically expand to accomodate any extent
 * of dataset.
 * <p>
 * This data structure is also known as an <i>MX-CIF quadtree</i>
 * following the terminology of Samet and others.
