/**
 * Constructs the Largest Empty Circle for a set
 * of obstacle geometries, up to a given accuracy distance tolerance
 * (which can be specified or determined automatically).
 * The obstacles may be any combination of point, linear and polygonal geometries.
 * <p>
 * The Largest Empty Circle (LEC) is the largest circle 
 * whose interior does not intersect with any obstacle
 * and whose center lies within a polygonal boundary.
 * The circle center is the point in the interior of the boundary 
 * which has the farthest distance from the obstacles 
 * (up to the accuracy of the distance tolerance).
 * The circle itself is determined by the center point
 * and a point lying on an obstacle determining the circle radius.
 * <p>
 * The polygonal boundary may be supplied explicitly.
 * If it is not specified the convex hull of the obstacles is used as the boundary.
 * <p>
 * To compute an LEC which lies <i>wholly</i> within
 * a polygonal boundary, include the boundary of the polygon(s) as a linear obstacle.
 * <p>
 * The implementation uses a successive-approximation technique
 * over a grid of square cells covering the obstacles and boundary.
 * The grid is refined using a branch-and-bound algorithm. 
 * Point containment and distance are computed in a performant
 * way by using spatial indexes.
