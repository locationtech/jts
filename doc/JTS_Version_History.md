* all Geometry methods are now reentrant (thread-safe)
* Fixed-precision coordinates are now stored in a rounded but non-scaled form.  This makes them compatible with non-precise (Floating) coordinates, and simplifies working with precise coordinates directly.  Mixed precision models are now supported in Geometry methods; method results are in the more precise of the input precision models.
* Offsets are no longer supported in the Fixed precision model.  This is necessary to allow storing fixed precision coordinates in a non-scaled form.  This does not reduce the total precision available, since coordinates are stored in a floating-point format.
* SRID and Precision Model are no longer checked for equality during Geometry operations.  This removes a limitation which provided little semantic benefit.


### Functionality Improvements

* added Geometry.isWithinDistance(Geometry g, double distance) method, to provide optimized proximity queries
* added Geometry.buffer(double distance, int quadrantSegments) method, allowing control over accuracy of buffer approximation
* added Geometry.getCentroid() method
* added Geometry.getInteriorPoint() method, which uses heuristic methods to return a point in the interior of a Geometry
* GeometryFactory.toGeometryArray now returns null if the argument is null

### Performance Improvements

* Removed unnecessary string construction in EdgeEndStar.propagateSideLabels()
* Eliminated unnecessary computation of self-intersections in rings during relate and spatial functions.  This provides a large increase in speed when working with large rings and polygons.  (Note that IsValid still checks for these self-intersections, which are illegal in LinearRings)
* Add short-circuit code to RobustLineIntersector to detect non-intersections more efficiently

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed ClassCastException occurring in GeometryCollection.getLength()
* Fixed bug in Edge Intersection insertion (replaced Coordinate#equals with equals2D to ensure that intersection creation is not sensitive to Z-value).
* Fixed handling LineStrings with too few points in GeometryGraph.addLineString
* Fixed: was not checking that MultiPolygons don't contain components with too few points.
* Fixed Envelope.distance() to return correct distance for all envelopes.
* Fixed a few Geometry methods to make them re-entrant.
* Fixed CoordinateList.closeRing() to ensure endpoints are not duplicated
* Fixed CGAlgorithms.signedArea() to use a simpler algorithm which is more robust and faster.
* Fixed bug preventing validating Rings containing an initial repeated point.

### API Changes

* Added default constructor to WKTReader.  It uses the default GeometryFactory
* Add two static intersects() methods to Envelope, to allow computing intersections with envelopes defined by points only.
* Dropped BinaryPower; its functionality is provided by DoubleBits in a more robust fashion.
* Removed a couple of redundant private static methods from Geometry; they have been replaced by methods in CoordinateArrays
* The Geometry class is now marked as Serializable

# Version 1.2

*Release Date: 7 October 2002*
### Semantics Changes

* JTS now allows Geometrys to have repeated points.  All operations will continue to perform as before.  This removes a significant incompatibility with the OGC spatial data model.
* TopologyExceptions may now be thrown by spatial overlay methods.  This helps to distinguish between code bugs and known robustness problems.  It also provides a machine-readable coordinate for the error location.

### Functionality Improvements

* RobustLineIntersector now uses "normalized" coordinates to maximize the accuracy of intersection computation.
* Upgraded Quadtree with more robust implementation
* Replaced IntervalTree with a more robust implementation of BinTree
* Added STRTree 2-D spatial index, which exhibits better performance than QuadTrees in many situations.
* Added EnhancePrecisionOp, which uses precisioning enhancing techniques to reduce the number of failure cases due to robustness problems.

### Bug Fixes

* fixed ConvexHull to use TreeSet instead of HashSet for coordinates
* Fixed isValid for GeometryCollections containing Polygons, which were sometimes erroneously returning a validity failure for correct Geometrys.
* Fixed bug in LineSegment.distancePointLine() which would return the incorrect distance for a LineSegment with two identical points
* Improved error handling in CGAlgorithms.isCCW()
* IsValid now checks for too few points in a geometry component (e.g. due to repeated points in a ring)

### API Changes

* added Stopwatch class
* added Geometry.getArea() and Geometry.getLength() methods
* added CGAlgorithms.signedArea() method
* added methods to LineSegment - closestPoint(), getLength()
* added CoordinateArrrays and CoordinateLists utility classes
* Added TopologyValidationError.getErrorType() method
* Added Envelope#intersects; deprecated Envelope#overlaps.
* Added Geometry#geometryChanged() method to allow signaling when Geometry coordinates have been mutated by a client class
* Added STRTree class implementing a Sort-Tile-Recursive spatial index (a variant of a packed R-tree)
* Deleted IntervalTree 1-D spatial index (replaced by BinTree)
* Add BinTree 1-D spatial index
